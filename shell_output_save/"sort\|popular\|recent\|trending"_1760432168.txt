  {'tag': 'a', 'text': "bitcoin has been pumping heavily in past days! and this trend will likely continue the whole month of october. we have a very likely scenario that will probably happen on bitcoin, and in this analysis i will tell you which one!\n\nthe elliott wave theory is one of the strongest tools that you can use to analyze the crypto market. why? even banks use this theory, and they pay in gold to expert elliott wave analysts. what we can see on the current chart of bitcoin is that we are clearly in wave 3. wave 1 and wave 2 are also very clear, so it's really hard to argue against this elliott wave count because it's pretty much a textbook example. that's very exciting because we can predict the future with a high probability of success. i drew an arrow on the chart so you see this prediction without any misunderstanding. together with the blue long-term trendline, i think we have an extremely strong resistance. if you sell bitcoin here and tell everyone that you sold the top at 131k, i would consider it a huge success.\n\nwhat about an alt season? i expect a strong alt season at the final stage of the bull run! and it should start anytime soon. buying altcoins seems to be a very clever idea, or exchanging bitcoin for altcoins as well. all we need is the btc.d or btcdomusdt.p to go down, which you can see for yourself on tradingview.\n\nso i think you see my prediction and i hope you like it! but what altcoins to buy? write a comment with your altcoin + hit the like button, and i will make an analysis for you in response. trading is not hard if you have a good coach! this is not a trade setup, as there is no stop-loss or profit target. i share my trades privately. thank you, and i wish you successful trades!", 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/L1uVS6OC-Bitcoin-ALT-SEASON-2025-Starting-sell-here-thank-me-later/', 'value': '', 'data_value': '', 'class': ['paragraph-t3qFZvNN']}
  {'tag': 'a', 'text': 'when i started trading someone told me something i’ll never forget: “if you can predict tomorrow’s newspaper headline, you understand the market.”\n\nhe didn’t mean i should chase news. he meant i should read structure so well that i know what kind of headline the market is already writing, before the mass even see it.\n\nand now, looking around online, i see the complete opposite. everywhere you look, there’s another “confluencer” talking about crypto with big words and zero understanding.\npeople selling dreams, memberships, and indicators, while they don’t even know what open interest or cvd means.\n\ni’m not here to sell anything. i’m here to help people actually learn how to read data and see through the noise. because what most of these so-called experts call “analysis” is just emotional guessing wrapped in confidence.\n\n what i called and what happened \n\nlast week i posted my “big dump” thesis.   \ni said bitcoin would swing fail above the highs, then drop into the 104k region. that is  exactly   what happened.\n\nprice ran the sweep into 126k, trapped the late buyers, and dumped straight into 104k.\n\n people blamed tariffs. the tariff headline was the spark. the fuel was crypto’s own positioning. \n\n why the structure was ready to snap \n\nbefore the crash, the data told the story clearly. \n\n \n stablecoin oi went from 257k to 285k contracts (+10.9%). that is new leveraged exposure.\n coin-margined oi dropped during the breakout, then rose again near the highs. shorts were fading strength.\n spot cvd stayed flat to slightly negative. real buyers were missing.\n the long/short ratio fell from 2.05 to 1.02 even while price kept climbing.\n \n\nthat’s what distribution looks like. buyers on leverage pushing price up while stronger hands sell into them. no real spot demand, just futures exposure.\n\nyou don’t need a macro event to fall. you only need a reason for those leveraged buyers to stop bidding. think of it like a crowded elevator. everyone keeps piling in as it moves up, feeling safe because it hasn’t stopped yet. but the moment one person hesitates, the weight shifts. when the next person panics, the whole thing drops.\n\nthat’s what happens when a market is driven by leverage instead of conviction. you don’t need bad news,  you just need hesitation. \n\nlook back at similar events. \n\n \n in may 2021, funding rates were insane, perps overloaded, and spot volume thin. elon musk tweeted about bitcoin’s energy use. that tweet didn’t cause the dump. it just made leveraged longs pause. the bids disappeared and the cascade started.\n in august 2023, evergrande headlines hit. bitcoin was sitting at resistance with flat spot cvd and rising oi. equities wobbled, crypto longs hesitated, and the structure collapsed within hours.\n in march 2020, when covid panic hit, bitcoin had already been stretched thin. funding was high, leverage was heavy, and liquidity was weak. the virus didn’t break the market, leverage did.\n \n\nleverage creates confidence until it doesn’t. price doesn’t fall because people start selling. it falls because nobody steps in to buy. headlines decide when the drop starts. structure decides how far it goes.\n\n why 104k was my first target \n\ni didn’t pick 104k out of thin air. that level was built on confluence.\n\n\n1) avwap from the april 7 auction\nthat swing low kicked off with massive volume. when a move starts with that kind of participation, the anchored vwap becomes a key reference for institutional flow. it represents the average cost of that whole auction, and when extended forward, it acts as a dynamic area where liquidity and algorithms interact.\n\nthat blue avwap line from april has been running right through the 104k region.\nit’s not that price revisited that auction, it’s that the anchored vwap from that event still marks the fair value area for that entire move.when price traded back down into that region, it met that same volume-weighted anchor, creating a major confluence zone that algos and larger players watch closely.\n\n  \n\n2) the june 22 breakout left an lvn\na new auction started on june 22 and pushed higher, leaving a low volume node behind.\nan lvn is a thin zone on the volume profile where the market moved quickly with little trade.\nmarkets often revisit these thin areas later to find balance or test unfinished business.\n\n  \n\n3) htf fibonacci cluster\nmultiple higher timeframe fibonacci retracements and extensions overlapped near the same 104k area. when several fib levels align with structure, that’s a strong confluence zone watched by both human traders and algorithms.\n\nthe 104k region was where the avwap line, lvn, and fib cluster all met. that’s not a random target. it’s a structurally defined area where liquidity concentrates and where markets tend to react sharply. and that’s exactly what happened.\n\n the spark versus the structure \n\nthe tariff headline didn’t cause the drop. it triggered it.\n\nthe structure was already unstable. leverage was maxed. spot demand was flat. funding was positive and rising. when the tariff news hit, traditional markets pulled back and crypto followed instantly. it wasn’t correlation, it was liquidity contagion.\n\ntraders managing multiple books de-risk across assets when volatility spikes. that creates a gap in liquidity. when the bids vanish, the market falls into the first real pool of resting orders — in this case, the 104k zone.\n\nyou saw the same mechanics during the march 2020 crash and the 2021 deleverage. external shocks trigger internal liquidation cascades. that’s why saying “this had nothing to do with crypto is completely wrong.\n\n this had everything to do with crypto.  it’s like blaming the thunder for breaking a window when the glass was already cracked. or saying the iceberg sank the titanic when the captain was already steering through a sea of warnings.\n\ncrypto was structurally weak. leverage was stretched, spot demand was gone, and funding was positive. when the headline hit, it didn’t cause the collapse. it just gave the market permission to do what it was already set up to do — unwind.\n\ncrypto is built on leverage.\nperpetual futures dominate volume.\nstablecoin collateral drives exposure.\nwhen external risk events change funding conditions or risk appetite, the crypto market reacts instantly because its structure is fragile by design.\n\n example: \nwhen yields spike, the dollar strengthens and funding costs rise. leveraged longs become more expensive to hold, so traders unwind positions.\nwhen equities dump, cross-asset desks reduce risk globally, which pulls liquidity out of crypto perps too.\n\nintermarket correlation always matters. macro sets the mood. but the speed and violence of crypto moves always come from leverage inside the system.\n\n how you can spot it next time \n\n \n compare spot cvd vs stablecoin cvd. if stablecoin cvd rises while spot stays flat or negative, the rally is leverage-driven.\n track open interest vs price. both rising together usually means exposure is building. confirm with spot flow.\n watch the long/short ratio. if it drops while price rises, shorts are entering and the move may be getting absorbed.\n anchor vwaps to real pivots like swing lows, breakouts, or liquidation spikes. those levels attract institutional flow.\n study volume profiles. lvns are thin and often retested. hvns are balance zones that attract price.\n map htf fib clusters for confluence. reactions are stronger when multiple timeframes agree.\n note single prints and thin brackets on tpo or volume profiles. these often act as magnets.\n when these factors line up, you don’t need to predict headlines.\n \n\nyou’ll already most likely know which headline will break the market.\n\n tldr \n\n \n the rally was leverage-driven: stablecoin oi up 10.9%, spot cvd flat, long/short ratio down from 2.05 to 1.02\n the swing fail at 126k was the final liquidity grab\n 104k was the target due to avwap + lvn + htf fib cluster\n the tariff headline was the spark, not the cause\n the crash was caused by leverage and missing spot demand\n crypto didn’t fall because of politics. it fell because the market was already begging for an excuse to reset.\n \n\nthe data showed it clearly weeks before the drop.\n\nif this helped you see the market a little clearer or made you think differently about how price really moves, please leave a like and drop a reaction. it keeps me motivated to keep posting real analysis, not the copy-paste bullshit hype that floods your feed every day.\n\n\ncheck the order flow data from 6 october here: ibb.co', 'href':

  {'tag': 'a', 'text': 'bitcoin has recently swept the all-time high, triggering a short-term reaction from liquidity resting above that level. this move often signals that the market has completed its buy-side run and is now seeking to rebalance inefficiencies created during the aggressive push upward. the current structure indicates that price is shifting momentum in the short term, preparing for a deeper retracement before resuming its bullish trajectory.\n\n imbalance and structure shift \nfollowing the liquidity sweep, a clear 4-hour imbalance (ifvg) has formed, acting as the first sign of bearish pressure entering the market. this inefficiency shows that the prior move lacked sufficient counter-orders, meaning price may need to return there to restore balance. the bearish move was further confirmed as price inverted a smaller 4-hour fvg, signaling a potential continuation to the downside in the short term.\n\n bearish scenario \nif the market continues to respect the newly formed ifvg, we could see a sustained bearish retracement develop. price may use this imbalance as a draw, seeking to fill deeper inefficiencies left behind during the prior expansion. this corrective phase is not necessarily a trend reversal but rather a short-term redistribution phase before buyers potentially step back in from lower levels.\n\n bullish scenario \nonce the 4-hour fair value gap below is filled, the market could begin forming a base for a new bullish leg. the liquidity collected from the downside move and the rebalancing of inefficiencies would give price enough fuel for a strong continuation higher. traders should look for a clean market structure shift or displacement from that demand area as the signal of renewed bullish intent.\n\n expectations and outlook \nin summary, bitcoin appears to be in a healthy retracement phase after sweeping liquidity at the highs. the 4-hour imbalance provides a clear short-term target for price to seek, and once filled, the bullish structure could resume. this setup favors patience, waiting for confirmation that the downside rebalancing is complete before anticipating another impulsive rally.\n\n conclusion \noverall, bitcoin’s structure suggests a temporary bearish move to fill the 4-hour fvg, followed by a potential bullish continuation once that inefficiency is resolved. watching how price reacts upon entering that zone will be key in determining whether the next expansion phase begins.\n\n ___________________________________ \n thanks for your support!\nif you found this idea helpful or learned something new, drop a like 👍 and leave a comment, i’d love to hear your thoughts! 🚀', 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT.P/uNJD9ymS-Bitcoin-Short-Term-Weakness-Long-Term-Strength/', 'value': '', 'data_value': '', 'class': ['paragraph-t3qFZvNN']}

  {'tag': 'a', 'text': "as i expected from the  previous analysis , bitcoin did start to drop and hit  its targets .\n\nnow, with the news that the  u.s.  might impose a  100% tariff on china , we saw bitcoin sharply sell off last night. actually, as i mentioned in my  previous ideas , the rally from about  $109,000  to around  $126,199(ath ) (which was a new  all-time high  for bitcoin) had relatively low volume. that was a sign that a correction might be on the way, and last night’s news just acted as a  trigger  to speed it up.\n\nin fact, what took  bitcoin 10 days  to climb was reversed in  about 4 days , showing how strong the sellers are right now.\n\n educational tip: you can use volume candles on tradingview to see which candles had higher volume—the thicker the candle, the more significant the move. \n\n now, the big question: will bitcoin keep dropping or bounce back?  \n\nright now, it’s sitting near a  cluster of support lines  and close to the daily  200_sma(daily)  and the  50_sma(weekly) , as well as a  heavy support zone($111,980-$105,820) . last night’s drop was basically the  first test of these supports .\n\nsince it’s the  weekend and volumes are usually lower,  we don’t expect a huge downward move in the next 48 hours. \n\n bitcoin  might do a pullback to the  broken resistance zone($114,820-$113,180)  and then continue its drop. \n\naccording to  elliott wave analysis , bitcoin seems to be completing a  microwave 4 of the main wave 3 . \n\ni expect that after  bitcoin completes , we might see it  continue downward  and fill the  cme gap($111,355-$109,915)  early in the next week.\n\n so, do you think the major correction for bitcoin has started or not? let me know what you think! \n\n note: in case the support lines break, there’s also a chance that we might see a  death cross  (where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average), which could signal further bearish momentum. \n\n note: around the $108,000 level, we have huge buy orders stacked up, which might act as a significant support zone. \n\n please respect each other's ideas and express them politely if you agree or disagree. \n\nbitcoin analysis (btcusdt), 4-hour time frame.\n\n be sure to follow the updated ideas. \n\ndo not forget to put a stop loss for your positions (for every position you want to open).\n\nplease follow your strategy and updates; this is just my idea, and i will gladly see your ideas in this post.\n\n please do not forget the ✅'  like '✅ button 🙏😊 & share it with your friends; thanks, and trade safe.", 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/7vUvrnW2-Bitcoin-Roadmap-Is-a-Major-Correction-the-Next-Stop/', 'value': '', 'data_value': '', 'class': ['paragraph-t3qFZvNN']}

\neverything comes from the key level.  any pattern whatever we trade if there is no key level than its all invalid. lets put the ranges and key levels together.\n\n🧪 bullish scenario \nif you see range just above the key level. smart money are building liqudity and there will be manipulation. if price is already on key level deep manipulation is not necessary.  🧪  bearish scenario \nif you see range just below the key level. smart money are building liqudity and there will be manipulation. if price is already on key level deep manipulation is not necessary. \n📌e xpansion + key level \nif range occurs not just right above the key level but is a bit more far, we can expect expansion to reversal profile.  expansion to the key level is tradable and reversal also if there was range. this. knowledge give us possible expansion trade towards key level. \n\n🧪 bearish scenario   🧪 bullish scenario   there are also tricks with false reversal just below / above key level, market maker often leave double top and bottom , just round a key level and make it looks like ar reversal. dont fall for this trap. its done on purpose to put you early in to trade and you will put sl exactly where you they need liquify - followed by expansion to the key level and reveal. targeting double top / bottom is high probability trade. \n\n🧪 bearish scenario   🧪bullish scenario  📌 summary of key level and profiles \navoid trading range , manipulation and retracements\ntrade only expansion and reversal profiles\n this might sound complicated, but if you spend time with this. you will be filtering just best trade setups , trading less and more accurately. \n\n david perk aka davefxhunter", 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT.P/LV2Ltw2h-Avoid-Market-Traps-and-filter-best-trading-setups/', 'value': '', 'data_value': '', 'class': ['paragraph-t3qFZvNN']}

  {'tag': 'a', 'text': "introduction \nthis analysis examines the recent price behavior of bitcoin against usdt on the daily timeframe. the chart highlights several key technical concepts, including a liquidity sweep at the highs, a daily fair value gap (fvg) acting as resistance, and the likelihood of a wick fill within a major imbalance zone. together, these elements provide valuable insight into how institutional traders may be engineering liquidity and preparing for the next significant move. understanding these areas can help traders anticipate high-probability reaction zones and better align with the market’s underlying structure.\n\n liquidity sweep \nthe market recently executed a liquidity sweep above previous swing highs, triggering buy stops and attracting breakout traders into the move. this sudden push to the upside was quickly rejected, signaling that smart money likely used this moment to gather liquidity and distribute positions. liquidity sweeps often serve as the market’s way of collecting orders before a reversal or retracement, indicating that the bullish momentum may be temporarily exhausted. this event sets the stage for price to rebalance inefficiencies left behind during the rapid move.\n\n daily fvg resistance \nfollowing the liquidity sweep, price left behind a clear daily fair value gap, which represents an area of imbalance caused by strong displacement. this gap often acts as resistance, where price is expected to return and mitigate before potentially continuing lower. the fvg provides an ideal area for institutional traders to reposition, as it offers a point of confluence between inefficiency and structure. if price reacts bearishly within this zone, it would strengthen the bearish outlook and suggest a continuation toward lower levels.\n\n wick fill \nthe large wick seen during the recent sell-off is an important feature of this chart. historically, big wicks tend to get filled by 50% to 65%, reflecting the market’s tendency to rebalance inefficiencies over time. the marked blue zone below shows where this fill is most likely to occur. this zone aligns closely with previous support levels and fibonacci retracement levels, further reinforcing it as a potential area of interest. a wick fill into this region could provide liquidity for future bullish movement, allowing the market to establish a more solid foundation for the next impulsive leg upward.\n\n conclusion \nin summary, the current daily structure of bitcoin suggests that price has completed a liquidity sweep at the highs and is now in the process of rebalancing inefficiencies through a possible retracement. the daily fair value gap above serves as a critical resistance zone where sellers may re-enter, while the wick fill area below marks a high-probability target for price to revisit before establishing new direction. traders should monitor how price reacts to these two regions, a rejection from the fvg coupled with a move toward the wick fill zone could signal the next significant swing opportunity. in this environment, patience and precision are key, as the market seeks equilibrium before its next major directional move.\n\n-------------------------\n\nthanks for your support. if you enjoyed this analysis, make sure to follow me so you don't miss the next one. and if you found it helpful, feel free to drop a like 👍 and leave a comment 💬, i’d love to hear your thoughts!", 'href': 'https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT.P/GPDRO8hg-Bitcoin-What-to-expect-from-this-week/', 'value': '', 'data_value': '', 'class': ['paragraph-t3qFZvNN']}
